Different approaches to solve the reaction-diffusion equations for CO2-bicarbonate-carbonate-hydroxide system in 1D and in 2D using Python packages.

* `1D CO2 reaction diffusion-SciPy.ipynb` solve the 1D, time-independent problem using using `solve_bvp` from the `scipy` package.  
* `1D CO2 reaction diffusion FEniCS.ipynb` solves the 1D, time-dependent problem using using the Newton's method non-linear solver the `FEniCS` finite element package.  
* `2D CO2 reaction diffusion FEniCS.ipynb` soolves the 2D,  time-independent and time-dependent problems using `FEniCS`. The solution is on a simple rectangular domain but it would be possible to generate more complex geometries with `GMSH` and import the mesh via the `meshio` package.
